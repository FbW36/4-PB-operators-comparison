// 0. Declare two variables "apples" and "oranges". Assign a value of 20 to apples. Assign a value of 30 to oranges.
let apples = 20;

let oranges = 30;

// 1. Check whether apples and oranges are equal.

console.log(oranges == apples);

// 2. Check whether apples and oranges are *not* equal.

console.log(oranges != apples);

// 3. Check whether apples is greater than oranges.

console.log(apples > oranges);

// 4. Check whether apples is less than or equal to oranges.

console.log(apples <= oranges);

// 5. Check whether oranges is greater than apples.

console.log(oranges > apples);

// 6. Declare another variable "mangoes" and give it a value of 5. Multiply mangoes and apples, and check whether this result is greater than mangoes added to oranges.

let mangoes = 5;

let mal = mangoes * apples;

console.log(mal);

console.log(mal > mangoes + apples);

// 7. Subtract mangoes from apples and check whether this result is less than oranges divided by mangoes.

let rest = apples - oranges;

console.log(rest < oranges / mangoes);

// 8. Check whether mangoes, apples and oranges are equal.

let;

// 9. Check whether the remainder of apples divided by mangoes and the remainder of oranges divided by mangoes are equal.

// 10. Check whether mangoes added to apples is greater than oranges minus mangoes. If it is not, find an operator which will give a result of true.

// 11. BONUS CHALLENGE: Try increasing script readability by adding question headings to your output before each result.
